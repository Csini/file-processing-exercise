Java is a high-level class-based object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once run anywhere WORA meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine JVM regardless of the underlying computer architecture The syntax of Java is similar to C and Cplusplus but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities such as reflection and runtime code modification that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages As of 2019 Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub citation not found particularly for client–server web applications with a reported 9 million developers 

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems Java platform The original and reference implementation Java compilers virtual machines and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses As of May 2007 in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-20-only license Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions

As of March 2023 Java 20 is the latest version while Java 17 11 and 8 are the current long-term support LTS versions

History

Duke the Java mascot

James Gosling the creator of Java in 2008

The TIOBE programming language popularity index graph from 2002 to 2022 Java was steadily on the top from mid-2015 to early 2020
James Gosling Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991 Java was originally designed for interactive television but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Goslings office Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java from Java coffee a type of coffee from Indonesia Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar

Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 10 in 1996 It promised write once run anywhere WORA functionality providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms Fairly secure and featuring configurable security it allowed network- and file-access restrictions Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages and Java quickly became popular The Java 10 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 10 language specification With the advent of Java 2 released initially as J2SE 12 in December 1998 – 1999 new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications The desktop version was renamed J2SE In 2006 for marketing purposes Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE Java ME and Java SE respectively

In 1997 Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java but it soon withdrew from the process Java remains a de facto standard controlled through the Java Community Process At one time Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge despite their proprietary software status Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System

On November 13 2006 Sun released much of its Java virtual machine JVM as free and open-source software FOSS under the terms of the GPL-20-only license On May 8 2007 Sun finished the process making all of its JVMs core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright

Suns vice-president Rich Green said that Suns ideal role with regard to Java was as an evangelist Following Oracle Corporations acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009–10 Oracle has described itself as the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK see the Android section

On April 2 2010 James Gosling resigned from Oracle

In January 2016 Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin

Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers game consoles to scientific supercomputers

Oracle and others highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java due to unresolved security issues in older versions

Principles
There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:

It must be simple object-oriented and familiar
It must be robust and secure
It must be architecture-neutral and portable
It must execute with high performance
It must be interpreted threaded and dynamic
